- 3 Conclusions
  - Theater seams to be the most popular category but only has about a 54 percent success rate
  - The two most successful months are the two summer months Jun and Jul
  - The Crowdfunding goals who set their goal for greater than 50000 were the least successful with only 37% and have the most percent canceled and 9%.

- Limitations
  One limitation with these Crowdfunding campaigns is usually different tier rewards but we can only guess the average donations per backer. We can't know how many backers donated a high amount or how many donated a low amount.

- Additional Tables/Graphs
  - A table that shows the average length of a campaign per category or sub category
  - A table that shows how many campaigns were successful by 200% or more
  - A table that shows the most popular category by country
 
- Mean or Median
  - I would say the Mean would better summarize the data
  - there is more variability with successful campaigns because there are many of them that go far above 100%.
