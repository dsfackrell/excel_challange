- 3 Conclusions
  1. Theater seams to be the most popular category but only has about a 54 percent success rate
  2. The 2 most succesful months are the two summer months Jun and Jul
  3. The Crowdfunding goals who set their goal for greater than 50000 were the least succesful with only 37% and have the most percent canceled and 9%.

- Limitations
  One limation with these Crowdfunding campains there is usally different tier rewards but we can only guess the average donations per backer. We can't know how many backers donated a high amount or how many donated a low abount.
